# Betaflight Unified Target Configuration Repository


## ATTENTION

Instructions have been updated as Betaflight is migrating to a new build API.

All targets need to include #defines for drivers to be included for accelerometer, barometer, gyro and magnetometer. Please update existing targets.

Betaflight will include a certified flag as new hardware specification requirements will be in place to improve quality. Documentation with more detailed guidelines will be provided on further notice.

Please contact us on Discord to be part of our certification program.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/TargetMaintenance/CreatingAUnifiedTarget.md) to create and publish a Unified Target configuration.
